the linux_secure_boot_ddk is not possible to compile with GPL user lib yet, due to broken GPL DDK user lib, all the function APIs in include header are not avail in libcal.a, linux_secure_boot_ddk need to cal sfzcrypto_cm_XXX API directly .

Well I am trying to say that the Inside Secure 2.3.1 GPL DDK is still wrong ... they forget to at least keep the CAL_Dispatcher part even if they dont want user to see their CAL_SW implementation.

Also GPL Lib is without SW ECDSA functions ... i can't authenticate the image, the most i can do is to decrypt the image.
